I"ô<p>I am starting my Postdoc Researcher position at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/applied-geophysics-petrophysics/">Delft University of Technology</a> today. My research is within the scope of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/applied-geophysics-petrophysics/staff/academic-staff/prof-dr-lg-laeslo-evers/">Prof. LÃ¤slo Eversâ€™</a> VIDI grant from NWO and aims to look at seismo-acoustic coupling. We are going to use signals from ground truth events (earthquakes, explosions, volcanic eruptions, landslides, etc.) in order to investigate the seismic and infrasonic components of the wave-field generated by these sources.</p>
