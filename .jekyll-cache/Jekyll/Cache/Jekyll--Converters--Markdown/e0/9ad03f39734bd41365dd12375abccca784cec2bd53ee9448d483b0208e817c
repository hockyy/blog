<p>Yesâ€¦ I finally submitted the final version of my Ph.D. dissertation today: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299134542_Seismic-Wave_Propagation_and_Ground_Motion_Prediction_During_Strong_Earthquakes_-_The_Dead_Sea_Transform">Seismic-Wave Propagation and Ground Motion Prediction During Strong Earthquakes - The Dead Sea Transform</a></p>

<p><strong>I still need to defend and graduate but it seems like the end of an era is inevitable.</strong> I enjoyed my time as a doctoral student very much. I was very fortunate to gain some serious skills in addition to the usual scientific research skill one might expect to gain during their Ph.D. I got to build a computational high performance cluster on which I computed my earthquake ground motion simulations. I got to deploy temporary seismic arrays in order to collect data in populated sedimentary basins. Although this data was not directly used in my Ph.D., I anticipate that I will use it down the road as it is a really nice dataset of continuous recordings. I got to TA several courses in geology, geophysics, geomechanics, and more at the undergraduate level, teach a full course on the <em>Dynamical Earth</em> to first year geology students while my advisor <a href="http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/struct/Pages/staff/MichaelTsesarsky.aspx">Prof. Michael Tsesarsky</a> was on sabbatical, and I was actively advising M.Sc. students in our group on a professional level. Perhaps I will have separate blog posts on those later on.</p>

<p>I have not secured a <em>real</em> postdoc position yetâ€¦ This is no easy task when you come from a fairly unknown university and were raised by academic advisors who are not very well known in the field of interest. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I think my advisors (<a href="http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/struct/Pages/staff/MichaelTsesarsky.aspx">Prof. Michael Tsesarsky</a> and <a href="http://www.gsi.gov.il/eng/?CategoryID=28&amp;ArticleID=505">Prof. Zohar Gvirtzman</a>) were absolutely fantastic, <strong>really</strong>, but neither of them comes from a seismology background. They made up for this in many other ways. I attended as many conferences and workshops as I wanted. This helped me make some connections myself. I met with a lot of good scientists and gave a ton of seminars all over. For a while had a good feeling but there were funding issues.</p>

<p>For now, I am heading for a short, in-between, postdoc at the Geological Survey of Israel (GSI) to work on underground tunnel detection. I have confident this will be meaningful work but probably not publishable (for obvious reasonsâ€¦) and that is less than ideal at this point.</p>
