I'm not doing really well lately. I creatied this blog just to keep up with my daily life. This segment is called Shorties. So it's basically an instagram post, but a little bit longer. It's a short post. That's why I call it shorties. 🩳

Aku mungkin akan pakai dua bahasa, senyamanku saja.

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CVBR2wx/activity.png" alt="activity" width="400"/><br> <b><i>To-Do List</i></b></div>

My well thought weekend plan got destroyed(?). All the deadlines coming in, can't be done well by me. It's 11:01 PM right now, and yet I still haven't finish all of my to-do list. 🕚

I'm not really good at planning things tho. Sometimes I planned stuff for a whole day, and I just ignore all of them. Ended up not solving them. This thing is called unproductivity. So why write a blog post? 😕

Hmm. I just want to give thanks to everyone. I'm not a believer myself. My faith is not that strong, but somewhere deep down in my heart I do still believe in higher power, in God. 🎌

I really wanna share my personal life here, but still being professional. I have to keep some stuffs over for privacy. So I'll share as much as I can, and keep private informations below the radar.

In shorties, I'll keep my mood color over in the title. So you would know what do you expect before you're reading stuff.

| Symbol | Mood  |
| :----: | :---: |
|   💝    | Best  |
|   ❤️    |   5   |
|   🧡    |   4   |
|   💛    |   3   |
|   💚    |   2   |
|   💙    |   1   |
|   💜    | Worst |

So yeah, I'm so tired today. I spent the whole day supervising online contest. I'm really tired and I just want a break/vacation for a day. Today I haven't done anything useful. So, I hate it.

After this, I'll just try my best to finish the Pengantar Organisasi Komputer's course and sleep.

See you!
