## Content

So, In competitive programming, I classify there are three kinds of problems:

- Optimizing
  - Finding minimum or maximum value
- Counting
  - Count how many ways to do something
  - Count the length of something
- Constructing **(This sometimes overlaps with optimizing)**
  - Make something so it satisfies a condition
  - Checking if its possible to do something

There are some operators that can be used as an inspiration:

- Arithmetic operator
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Division
  - Multiplication
  - Exponentiation
  - Modulo
- Bitwise operator
  - And
  - Or
  - Xor
  - Not
- Shuffling operator
  - Swapping two elements
  - Inserting element(s)
  - Pushback or Pushfront element(s)
  - Reversing a segment or subsequence
  - Flipping bit(s), segment, or subsequence
  - Sorting a segment or subsequence
- Math-heavy operator
  - Combination, permutation, binomial, and derangements **(FFT is here)**
  - GCD and LCM
  - Inclusion and exclusion principle
  - Sequence and summation
  - Logarithm, binary, and N-ary operation
  - Prime and factorization
  - Geometry

There are some important objects and (data) structures that can be used as well:

- Strings
- Array
- Grid or Matrix
- Tree and Trie
- Directed and Undirected Graph
- Segment Tree
- Fenwick Tree (Binary-Indexed Tree)
- Queue, Deque, and Stack
- Linked-List
- Priority Queue, Set, and Ordered Set
- Square-Root Block Decomposition
- Geometry Objects

Now you have to look for theme:

- Food
- Stones
- Time
- Box
- Chess
- Game
- Sport
- Animal
- Themeless

Pick 3-5 of your poison and voila!
