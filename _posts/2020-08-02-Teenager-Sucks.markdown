## What This Post is

Hi! I was having a bad day one week ago. 😆

Angry me wrote this funny blog without me noticing that I'm actually being really harsh and will offend people around me. ☹️

Human sucks, they made bad decisions and always think what they're doing is right. When they're hungry 🤤, horny 😍, and angry 😠, they lose their sense of control. Can't even think straight. That's why we should think twice. Now let's see what I *DID* when I was angry. I wrote a weird cringe teenager post.

## The Cringey Truth

The title is supposed to be **An Analysis on Why Bakugou Hates Deku**, and the excerpt is *Midoriya deserves "one for all" but he has a salty personality that everyone in real life hates. 😠* Here's how it goes:

### What Boku no Hero Academia is

Boku no Hero Academia is one of my all-time favorite anime. It revolves around a universe where people have superpower (the **quirk** they call), unless for some of those (who is unlucky enough to be the ~20%). Welp out of all the main characters I’ve seen, only about 3 people I recall quirkless. legit 20% as the wiki and opening says but OK. 

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/p1SJ166/image.png" alt="Deku and All Might" width="300"/><br> <b><i>Deku and All Might</i></b></div>

So, this Deku (Midoriya Izuku) guy, he is totally cool. He obsessed over a #1 top rank "Hero", named **All Might**. **Hero** is just like the “Police” in this universe and of course their quirks are awesome. One day, his favorite hero met him and gave him his quirk. The quirk is basically mighty strength enhancement. Classic, yet powerful.
He went to a senior high, in a class of 20 people, where he learns to control the quirk he just received while All Might is slowly getting weak and dying. This is sad ngl.

So let me tell you why I lowkey hate Deku, and why his -*childhood friend now turns into that one guy who constantly screams at him because knowing Deku just went into literally the best senior high for "Young Hero" in their area while not showing any superpower until less than a year of getting in the school*- Katsuki Bakugou hates him so much.

### Deku's Sucky Personality

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DQk109M/Deku-Trying.jpg" alt="Deku-Trying" width="300"/><br> <b><i>Smol Deku Tried to Help Bakugou</i></b></div>

He loves to help people, even though we all know that he is such a weak snail. He got the balls to punch god tier enemies and handle bad situations with his bare hands. Even though DEKU IS QUIRKLESS.
 
This is stupid. In real life, you do not help people because "Oh I will help you even if I can't solve my own problem because seems like you're struggling". It is just so UNREAL!

He is lucky af, even I would not be surprised if the writer reveals that his main superpower is just literal luck. We all know that main characters will always have that *plot armor*. But damn, I never see him lose just one important fight. His enemies always underestimated him. Not only that, all the enemies he faces, turn into a no brain punch and gun fighter.

I mean like, Dude. You guys got crazy cool quirks, this Deku guy literally just **got** his quirk. Really? Where is that teamwork boii. Even I can win a 4v5 CS:GO game if all my teammates can communicate. Teamwork makes the dream works, as simple as that.

When things got good, the enemy holds into him and starts to do a 3-minutes "I win, you lose" lecture. His friends/high school teachers will always come to help him, RIGHTT before he is killed. And yet, another day of Deku saved by a slight glimpse.

This show literally made people think “Oh yeah, helping people is good. Minding other’s condition is better rather than self-correcting yourself.” No. Real life is not like that. At all.

### Ignorance is Bliss

People have their own private space and time. Do not mind other’s business! For real, get your own life. Know your place. If I am fat, so be me. If I do not like being fat, that is my own choice. Stop asking people “Hey what’s your religion?” “Hey you look weird because you aren’t as fat as you used to be?” “Oh Hey, you’ve been married for 2 years, children got or not?”.

Not being a hypocrite, I can’t deny having thoughts over things I don’t like. I still think of “Oh damn you look so damn weird and *exotic*” (No offense, I’m cool with them). But I tried to not let my brain sinks in and my mouth spits the cursed thought out of my mind and let the whole world knows what I’m thinking about.

## Closing

Let's just be real. The post sucks, and you can't even get anything from it. It doesn't even explain who's Bakugou. The reader don't even know the context of the last part. 💯

Moral of the story, you should hold yourself. Self control is important. ☀️

Have a good day!
