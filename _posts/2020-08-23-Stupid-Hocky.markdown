## Introduction

It's Sunday 12:52 AM, 23rd of August, 2020. Right now I'm typing this because I feel so unproductive. Tomorrow (Or should I say today, but the day resets when you sleep 😴, so it's tomorrow) will be the final of Find It! Competitive Programming Competition, held by Universitas Gadjah Mada.

So my team consists of Me, Julian, and Kak Fairuzi. Team name is "Just For Happiness", as you know, the JFH initial stands for our name. 🐸

I just took a bath and found a pretty good idea on what should I write next. It's going to be "How to Be Fast in Toilet" (like 20 minutes, all stuffs done kind of fast). 🛀

Well me myself, sometimes I have the will and inspiration for a post in a stupid situation. Where I know, after I'm outta this situation, I won't be able to write the post and the idea will just be buried with all my unproductivity. 

## Before "The Bath"

So, this morning our family just held a birthday party for me. The party went so early, because they somehow have to go to Mempawah, where my father's family lives. In Chinese culture, there is this festival, called the Qingming Festival, also known as Ceng Beng, sembahyang kubur, or ziarah kubur. 🏮

Basically, it's a way to respect our ancestor, great grandparents so that they live happily ever in the afterlife.

My family and I respect the culture and at least both of my parents attend the festival back in Mempawah, Kalimantan Barat. 💯

I just finished my session of Dota 2, a game which changed my whole summer into a tragedy of addiction (Holy F, I'd rather addicted by porn not gonna lie) 👎

## Before "The Tragedy"

Just like how some people addicted to drugs, meths, or the "Ganja" people say here. I was basically in a circle of friends who also play Dota 2. 👽

Aight, so TL;DR. I have played Dota 2 for 200 hours back in 2015. But it was a no-no for me. Plus, we got no WiFi here in Pontianak. So if I wanna play a game, I had to install steam and the game for another 15 GBs No shit, normal people wouldn't do that. 🥇

But this "Hocky Yudhiono" ain't no normal people. He spent his mobile data to install CS:GO for 10 GBs. Wait, I thought you say you are addicted to Dota? 🎨

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fYLmT82/csgo.png" alt="csgo-steam" width="400"/><br> <b><i>CS:GO Addict</i></b></div> <br>

Yes, but I was more of a CS:GO player. It was a mere experience, because I had no friends to play with. 🎱

I decided to install Dota 2 for another 15 GBs. 😦

Holy, now you see how there are still stupid people in this world. ❌

It was way before some of this blog posts. Like the first 2 week of summer, I just installed Dota 2 on this PC. And by that, the tragedy officially began. 🎀

## The Tragedy

Yea, I played a lot. I admit it, no more shitty denial. 🎮

Could've spent my time writing a post on Square-Root Decomposition problem I solved recently. But damn, this Hocky guy so damn stupid idiot dumb moron. 😦

## The Bath Begins

Alright, after the birthday party. I was literally hungover because I feel so full and fat. 🏭

My eldest sister (she's a doctor) 🏥, came from Entikong, where she works, just to attend the party. Her friends came for a visit after the early morning party (now in the evening), and they (also Hocky included) talk for quite some time. We had good times. ☔️

While I was playing this game, they assigned me to mop the lower floor of our house. (My parents already in Mempawah because its 10PM now, they went there the later afternoon). ☀️

It was an easy task. I got pretty upset to myself because I keep letting myself in over Dota. It reminded me of this hilarious meme I found several years ago. 🐸

But it was more of like this. 🎲

I'm so sleepy, gonna continue the blog tomorrow.
See you soon! 😄

> Hocky left the post

> Hocky joined the post

It's 9:40 AM, our team literally just solved all problems on the contest. 💯

So here I go, trying to finish this post

## The Bath

So have you ever heard your family screaming on you while you're in the toilet because you spent too much time in there? This is a good tips on how to avoid that. 🥇

> Don't bring your phone, and multitask!

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JyJW4jK/hp-toilet.jpg" alt="poo-poo phone" width="400"/><br> <b><i>Playing Phone While Poo-Poo</i></b></div> <br>

People do this, including me. But trust me, if you didn't, you can do many more stuffs in the toilet while doing poo-poo. 💩

- First things first, you can brush your teeth while poo-pooing. 👅  
- If you're done, but you still have lots of business, start to pour some water to your body. 🍉  
- Clean your body from the top, this includes shampooing and washing your face. 👊  
- And just rub over your body with your favorite soap. 💦  

And, done! it only takes me apprx. 20 minutes to finish my businesses in the toilet.

For comparison, it usually took me 45-60 minutes. 🕥

## The Mistake

So last night, Kak Prabowo (I'm his assistant for TROC contest-setting on TLX) asked me to do some stuffs. 🤡

> I'm a total dick. Why? 💢

Because I have a responsibility to do something, and I simply making some slow and shitty progress on it. ☹️

So I did what most of people do.

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dtrqpZ8/Steam-Here-We-Go-Again.png" alt="open-steam" width="400"/><br> <b><i>Opening Steam</i></b></div> <br>

No I didn't try to play Dota. 🐝

> I tried to uninstall the s*** out of it 🚢

## The Griefs

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yWCBBDD/Uninstall-Dota.png" alt="uninstall" width="400"/><br> <b><i>Uninstalling Dota 2</i></b></div> <br>

I thought, damn. The elephant is not only Dota. So I decided to get rid of CS:GO as well. When I tried it, I was curious with another button when I open the select menu over the game. I saw a "Hide" button.

Wait shit, why?

Shouldn't I just hide the game instead of uninstalling it?

> No, I shouldn't. Your worst enemy is yourself.

I tried to hide the CS:GO because I was curious on how it works. 🔫

Well, it took me quite some time and googled on how to unhide the thing. 🎲

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k4NKndd/Uninstall-CSGO.png" alt="uninstall" width="400"/><br> <b><i>Uninstall CS:GO</i></b></div> <br>

At the end of the day, I unhide CS:GO, uninstall it, and hide it again. (For extra protection).<strike>No this isn't a condom ad 👎</strike>. So I chatted him and make this some sort of an "apology" on what I've done, burdening him over stuffs. If you're reading this, I'm so sorry.

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/x2G4QbM/Tips-Addiction.png" alt="chat" width="300"/><br> <b><i>The Chat</i></b></div> <br>

He told me to uninstall steam, but I couldn't. I still have one more stuff to do, that is to finish this post. (For the content, I need some screenshot) 📷

## The Acceptance

No shit, I bet stupid me wouldn't just let go of this situation and will certainly find another addiction. Let's hope it's going to be solving CP problems. 💻
