Today's mood is broken. I woke up 7 AM, ended up sleeping again and woke up 9 AM. I accidentally missed my 8 AM class. Damn my dad went mad and angry. He's got a point tho. I don't really need to do anything, like bath or anything. Yet, I still missed the class.

But this destroyed my mood and you know, thanks for it now I hate helping people. If my life is a movie this is one of the episode where the author put the character's development all in.

Now I'm the antagonist of my own story. So yeah, this is just another warning for me. Well, this is not the first though. I always remind myself not to help anyone with their stuffs (unless you're being paid, yet you have to keep it professional) for free.

Why?

- You can be a learner. Why teach? You'll just be another stepping stones for those who is better than you. You're awful and a disgrace.
- I now I'm being selfish, but if you're not 100% yet why help people who's trying to reach 100%? Get up and help yourself dude. Get a life.
